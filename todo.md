## Update README 
### Add implementing section
 - Client must implement a handler for the `"mcfunction/shutdown"` notification, as there is no way that I can see to stop the server gracefully from the server side.  
 This notification should make the client send the server a shutdown and exit request.

## To be implemented protocol commands
 - `mcfunction/shutdown` (c <- s) (required): Client should call `shutdown` and `exit`
 - `mcfunction/highlight` (c <-> s) (optional): Request to get highlighting scopes. Request Data: 
```ts
export interface HighlightParams {
    textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;
}
```  
Response Data: 
```ts
export interface HighlightResponseParams {
    highlights: HighlightScope[];
}

interface HighlightScope {
    ids: string[];
    range: Range;
}
```
